\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We tested and compared several classifiers with the 12 features extracted from 
the dataset. After the algorithm tournament and the McNemar test, we can 
conclude that the Maximum Entropy classifier, the Linear Discriminant Analysis 
(LDA) and the Naive Bayes classifier are good classifiers for the task of 
predicting if a tweet will be retweeted or not. Trained with our features, we 
obtain accuracies greater than 91\%.
