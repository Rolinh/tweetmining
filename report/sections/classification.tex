\section{classification}

In this work, we used and compared the 5 following classifiers :

\begin{itemize}
 \item Naive Bayes
 \item {Support Vector Machine (SVM)
	\begin{itemize}
	 \item with a RBF Kernel
	 \item with a Sigmoid Kernel
	\end{itemize}}
 \item Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt)
 \item Decision Tree
 \item Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
\end{itemize}

We excluded the Support Vector Machine from the cross-validation and 
the algorithm tournament because of its high computation time due to the huge
dimensionality of the problem.
