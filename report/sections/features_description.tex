\section{Features description}
\label{sec:features}

In this section, we describe the features that we used in our experiment.

Some features are actually more significant than others, i.e. they provide a 
better information in order to tell if a tweet will be retweeted or not.
The more features we use, the more the computation becomes 
complex. This increased complexity is more significant with a classifier such 
as the SVM, because of the increased dimensionality, than on some other 
classifier such as the Naive Bayes but this mean nevertheless that we need to 
circumscribe the number of our features. Furthermore, some features may provide 
such an irrelevant, or even non existent, increase of useful information that 
they shall just be removed.

In order to perform the feature selection for classification, various methods 
such as information gain (IG) and chi-square (CHI) can be used. We used the 
latter to determine which features were relevant for our case.

The table \ref{tab:features} lists all the features, order from the most 
significant to the less significant. Features that have been dropped are in 
italic font.

The first feature is based on the fact that a tweet can be a retweet 
itself. This information can be extracted from the text of the tweet which 
appears as a citation of the original tweet in the form "RT @username:". 

The feature number 2 determines whether a tweet is a reply to another 
tweet.This information is provided by the attribute "in\_reply\_to\_user\_id" 
which contains a non-null value if the tweet is a reply.

The third feature counts the number of followers the author has. This value 
is given by the \emph{User} object attached to a tweet.

The feature number 4 indicates how many times a tweet has been "favorited" by 
other users. This count is given by the attribute "favorite\_count"  of a tweet 
object.

The fifth feature gives the number of other tweets (including retweets) issued 
by the author. This information is provided by the attribute "statuses\_count" 
of the \emph{User} object.

The feature number 6 indicates if the author of the tweet has a verified 
account. Such accounts establish the authenticity of the user's identity. In 
our case, this means that the author of the tweet is famous and then he will be 
probably retweeted.

The seventh feature is the number of friends (aka the number users following 
the author). This count is provided by the \emph{User} object. The number of 
friends is strongly related to the number of retweets.

The feature number 8 counts the number of hashtags from the \emph{Tweet} 
object and the feature number nine is the number of words of the tweet.

The tenth feature gives the number of users mentionned with a "@username" in 
the tweet. This information is calculated from the list of "user\_mentions" 
given by the \emph{User} object.

The feature number 11 indicates if the tweet contains an URL or not. The 
list of URL is provided by the \emph{Tweet entities} object.

The feature number 12 uses the TF (Term Frequency). The words occurrences 
used to compute the TF are calculated as explained in the previous section.

Since the two last features did not give good results, they have been 
removed. The Tweet age were not significant while the TF-IDF (Term Frequency - 
Inverse Document Frequency) feature did not work due to a bug in the 
\emph{scikit} library.
