\section{Introduction}

Twitter is a microblogging system in which users cand send, reply, or forward
(retweet), short messages up to 140 characters between them. Typically, users
are inter-connected by messages and they form social network communities in
which different topics are discussed. Messages which are retweeted several times
are thus more likely to represent important topics that people like to discuss.
In this project, we analyzed twitter data and built models for solving 
the following task: to predict if a tweet will be retweeted or not, i.e. to 
predict if a tweet can be considered as popular or not insight a community.

To do so, we had to develop our own data mining tool and propose an
approach to solve the problem.

Our analysis was made on a recent collection of $42960$ tweets, all of which 
are related to the global topic of \textit{shampoo}.

Each tweet is characterized by some features which we used, along with others 
we created, mostly built on the tweet's content, to compute our prediction.

Our approach was to first extract informative features from the tweets and then 
use them into various classifiers to do our prediction. We determined which 
features were the most informative and which classifier performed the best by 
doing algorithm tournament.
